"Can an Omnipotent God create a stone that he cannot lift?"
For both Yes and No, God no longer remains Omnipotent (i.e. One who can do everything)


• Proof by the above paradox is fallacious. 


Why :
You need to understand Set theory and Symbolic logic to comprehend the discrepancy. 

Omnipotence imply he can lift all stones. 

-> Stones that God can lift = {Universal set of all stones}
-> Stones that God cannot lift = Negation of the Universal set = {} 
(i.e. Empty Set or Nothing)


If We say God cannot make "a stone he cannot lift" we are essentially saying God Cannot make "Nothing"

"God cannot make nothing" does NOT contradict with "God can make everything" 

Why it's category fallacy : 
"Can" is stated about one category, "Cannot" is stated about another category (what is nothingness). Then the conclusion said it's Paradox.
Paradox can only happen when "can" and "cannot" is stated about the same category. 



Symbolic Analysis:
Why the second statement (God cannot make nothing) does not contradict the first statement (God can make everythin)? 
Lets look at there symbolic representation 

Let, 
x = anything
P(x) = the ability to make "x"

Can Make Everything = ∀x P(x)
 [translation : For all  x, P(x) is valid]

Cannot Make Nothing  = ~(∀x ~P(x)) 
[translation : (∀x ~P(x)) means "for all x, P(x) is invalid i.e. Can Make Nothing. Then put another Negation beforehand ]
There is double negation so after applying De-Morgan it becomes 
~ (∀x ~P(x))  ≡ ∃x P(x) 


We know,  ∀x P(x) does not contradict ∃x P(x)
