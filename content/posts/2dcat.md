+++

Once upon a time, there lived a 3-Dimensional kitten behind the bookshelves of this library situated beside a busy road of the city.

She was timid, unsocial and foodie. 

She had a name - Kat - given by her only friend,  Riemann, as he would go by, who frequented the library to quench his curiosity about the cosmos and discuss them with her. 
"You know," he used to say, "in higher dimensions - laws of the universe are simpler, thus spoke Einstein and solved two perennial problems of science." 

Kat would always meow in agreement. 

Riemann was a boy on the spectrum. 

One morning, the sneaky little Kat was in the pursuit of her breakfast. darting across the road again and again in search of delicious leftovers. 
When a proud owner of a brand-new Premio rolled over her.
Her soft flesh was pressed flat against the ground.


Riemann that morning, found her Kat 2-Dimensional  and wondered if perhaps Einstein had been wrong - perhaps the laws of the universe were *truly* simpler in that lower second dimenion, where Kat had gone.
