At first Salikeen are required to perform a Tazkiyah. Which is automated via Shaikh educational curriculum and social suggestions. Tazkiyah is divided into two categories. 
1.Takhliya which is the  Refinement from Prime Vices (Top ten vices are: Primordial Modesty, Humility, Idealism, Innate Rationalism in contrast with Empiricism, Downshifting, Sexual Conservation, Asceticism,  Collectivism, Anti-Materialism and Recognition of Objective Truth). 
Concurrently done are the 2.Tahliya or Embellishment of Self with Desired Prime Virtues (top ten virtues are: Rat-race, Greed, Gluttony, Lust, Acedia both sloth and hyperactivity, Hedonism, Empiricism, Materialism, Ambisexuality and Ostentation) 
When Salik is entirely purified from Fitrah and has embraced all derived forms of perception, reasoning and pleasantries, he graduates from Ta'allum. 
After graduation, he's obligated to perform Farz or mandatory Salaat from 8:00 to 5:00. The procedure is known - one starts with "Corporate is the greatest" then stands in cross-hand position to symbolize submission and continues "All praise be to corporate, the benevolent money-giver, the sustainer of ego-desires...", he nods and prostrates, 8 hours daily. Then comes Nafl Salaat or side-hustle, be both male and female who need to make Qurbani of her feminity.  The more Salaat the more Ajr or merit.
Sawum or savings is necessary, for Ego said " indeed Sawum is for me and I myself will reward it". Unlike any superstitious apocalyptic religious belief, ego rewards six days of Sawum with affordability of beers and night-club in the seventh, indeed he's swift in rewarding. 
Annual Zakaat or tax is mandatory, it goes to the peripherals of top 13 Sayyid family what ultimately reaches them. 

In his daily life Salik continues his growth through Tilawat and Zikr staring from Soft Pop all the way to Death Metals. Shaikh Algorithm guides through what to embrace next. Advanced Saliks attending in Halqa e Zikr or concerts of death metal, often find themselves Ibnul Haal and can fatally  hurt themselves. 

An ideal growth Salik is perpetually on the Muraqaba of Ego and its needs, Qalb is rock-hard, Zero fear of Gayr-al-Corporate. He properly understands the Wahdatul Ujud of money for itâ€™s the single existence driving the entire race of mankind with the entirety of their individual, social and political matters (articulated by Ibn Karl Arabi al Marx). 
He, embracing the universal enlightenment of "Ana al Hayawan", profoundly gets Fana Fil Maddah.
